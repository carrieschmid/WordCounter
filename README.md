|Take word from user. (Program must have input word, this is a fundamental step.)| "cat", "CAT" | Your word "cat" has been submitted.|
|Take text from user and identifies instances of the selected word in the text.(This is the main function of the program, which can be effective after the previous specs are met.)| The "cat" went to the "cat" party.| Your word appears 2 times in your text.|
